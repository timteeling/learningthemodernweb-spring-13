<h2>Design an HTML version of your resume.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Yes it must be your real, complete resume as you'd send to a potential employer.</li>
<li>You must take into account everything we have learned so far.</li>
<li>You must use the normalize.css reset from cdnjs.com</li>
<li>You must use a professional looking font from google.com/webfonts (google around for "good google web fonts" if you're not sure what to use)</li>
<li>Your CSS should be in its own separate CSS file.</li>
<li>You may include a picture of yourself if you'd like but you don't have to.</li>
<li>If you're uncomfortable including your mailing address or phone number you may leave it out but you must include at least your email address (as a clickable link) as a form of contact</li>
</ul>


<h3>Other things to consider:</h3>

<ul>
<li>font size</li>
<li>line spacing</li>
<li>measure (characters per line)</li>
<li>colors</li>
</ul>


<h3>Potential for bonus points:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make your resume fluid to scale and look good on devices of all sizes</li>
<li>Going above and beyond the previously stated requirements</li>
</ul>


<h3>The following will reflect on your grade poorly:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Not putting any thought or time into this project</li>
<li>Using table based layouts</li>
<li>Using deprecated HTML such as <font>, <center></li>
<li>Using styles inline. don't do this: <code>&lt;h1 style="margin-bottom:3em;"></code></li>
<li>Grammatical errors</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>The link to your resume must be emailed to me.  It should be located at http://yourdomainname.com/resume/index.html</p>
