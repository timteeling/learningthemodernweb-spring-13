<h2>Create a Static Website</h2>

<ul>
<li>This should be a multipage site that you will continue to develop through the rest of the semester.</li>
<li>I will be partaking in this project as well. I have begun to redesign my own portfolio site here: <a href="http://timteeling.com/dev/tt4/">http://timteeling.com/dev/tt4</a></li>
<li>This should most likely be a portfolio site. If you'd like to build different kind of site, then please let me know beforehand.</li>
<li>For a portfolio site, you should include, a short bio of yourself, a resume, porfolio of your work, and optionally a blog if you'd like to have one.</li>
<li>You must take into account everything we have learned so far.</li>
<li>You must use the normalize.css reset from cdnjs.com</li>
<li>You must use a professional looking font from google.com/webfonts (google around for "good google web fonts" if you're not sure what to use)</li>
<li>Your CSS should be in its own separate CSS file.</li>
<li>You must put a lot of thought into the design</li>
<li>You may use a framework such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="http://zurb.foundation.com">Zurb</a> but you must restyle element beyond the defaults given. Your grade will suffer if your site doesn't look unique from the framework you choose.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Other things to consider:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Font size</li>
<li>Line spacing</li>
<li>Measure (characters per line)</li>
<li>Color Schemes</li>
<li>Other content to include</li>
<li>Navigation patterns</li>
<li>Personal logo or mark</li>
</ul>


<h3>Potential for bonus points:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make your resume fluid to scale and look good on devices of all sizes</li>
<li>Going above and beyond the previously stated requirements</li>
</ul>


<h3>The following will reflect on your grade poorly:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Not putting any thought or time into this project</li>
<li>Just using defaults from frameworks and not making them your own</li>
<li>Using table based layouts</li>
<li>Using deprecated HTML such as &gt;font>, &gt;center></li>
<li>Using styles inline.</li>
<li>Grammatical errors</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>The link to your site must be emailed to me.  It should be located at http://yourdomainname.com. If you're concerned about other files you have on your server being lost, or misplaced, please let me know ahead of time and I'll make sure you won't overwrite things that you don't want to overwrite.</p>

<h3>Asking For Help</h3>
<p>Please make an effort to troubleshoot issues that you run into. The majority of issues are either spelling mistakes, or missing quotation marks, equal signs, or incorrect file references. I understand things can get frustrating and that's why I'm here to help.  While I want you to take a deep breath and troubleshoot, please don't drive yourself insane. Email me with questions.</p>
